# SpeedBay Project Overview

## Project Structure
This project will be built as a monorepo containing:
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript

## Development Process
The project will be built systematically using Cursor Composer prompts:
- Commands will start with slashes (e.g., `/refactor`, `/install`)
- Each command should be executed sequentially
- Prompts will be pasted into Cursor one at a time

## Deployment Target
The project will be prepared for deployment on Railway.

## Build Process
1. Set up monorepo structure
2. Configure backend (Node.js + TypeScript)
3. Configure frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)
4. Prepare deployment configuration

## Note
This README serves as a reference for the project structure and build process. The actual implementation will be done through a series of Cursor Composer prompts that will be provided separately.
